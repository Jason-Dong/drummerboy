# musicgen

musicgen is a collaborative project by Jason Dong and [Dylan Reimer](http://www.dylanreimer.com/) seeking to create a physical instrument/synthesizer that utilizes Google’s open source [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) library. The general structure of the project can be seen in the diagram below:

Inspired by other projects showcasing Magenta’s potential and Google’s hardware implementation [NSynth Super](https://nsynthsuper.withgoogle.com/), musicgen attempts to use the Magenta library to create an instrument that uses machine learning yet also carries musical potential and inspires musicians.
